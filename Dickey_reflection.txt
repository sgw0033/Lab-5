From what I have learned from this class, the best way to manage and document
code is by making sure that I include comments and README's for everything
that I do so that my work is easy to follow along and other people would be
able to do the exact same thing from following my directions. I have learned 
that one of the most important things in code is making sure that other people 
can clearly  follow along and be able to perform the same thing by following
our directions. All of the stuff completed in this class should be able to
 stand up to a reproducibility test since we are explaining everything that
 we do. I think non-reversible research contributes to computational biology
 and informatics in a negative way because if you don't know where the answer
 or reasoning came from, then you don't know what to fix or how to fix a problem
 since you dont know where it came from. This goes for any type or information
 in any field of biology, I think everythin needs to be clearly backed up and
 sourced so people can choose if they agree or disagree based on what they know
 from the information and facts provided.
