Lab 5 Reflection Question
I currently manage my documents and code in a way that makes sense to me but would not be able to be reproduced very well. My documents are all stored in folders that correspond to the class or project they belong to but if someone else was looking for a specific document in my files it might not be as easy for them to find as it is to me. As for my code, I keep notes of everything I am doing on a notes document on my iPad and change things as I go but I erase what is wrong and only keep the final code and why we used it. So if someone were to go look at it they wouldn’t be able to see what all has been done already and what didn’t work because the only thing that would be there is the final correct code or script. This would not stand up to a reproducibility test because the methodology and data would not be included in the notes that I have and someone else would not be able to follow it and reproduce the same results. I think non-reproducible research affects computational biology and bioinformatics by inhibiting the field because everyone is having to start code over from scratch instead of being able to use someone else’s code and add to it and improve it. If everyone is starting from scratch on their own code and scripts on problems that a lot of people are trying to solve it is just holding back the advancement of the field. In my specific field of study non reproducibility would severely hinder the advancement of the field. Genetics needs to build on other people’s work, take the human genome project for example, if people could not take other people’s data and reproduce it for themselves in order to do the same research on their own data.
