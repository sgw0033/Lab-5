Would it stand up to a reproducibility test?

I think my older documents and code would not stand up to a reproducility 
test. My first code and README documents did not have any commentary and 
were not well documented at all. My more recent projects have improved 
through the use of commentary in programs and markdown formatting in 
github. I think these recent projects would better stand up to a 
reproducibility test.

How do you think non-reproducible research affects computational biology 
and informatics?

I think non-reproducible research harms computational biology and 
informatics. If good research has been done, it would be awesome if this 
research is reproducible and could be used in similar future projects. 

What about in your specific field of study?

I think non-reproducible research also harms the genetic field. 
Non-reproducible research in genetics is extremely unhelpful. If a clever 
code for running sequences is created, this would be best if reproducible.
